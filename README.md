# Internet of Things CITS5506 team project
Our proposed project is to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor to measure electricity generation from a small solar panel, which can then be analysed and extended to determine the potential generation at a specific location from a larger (residential-sized) rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

This application can be deployed locally, install git and clone the reposistory.

Get the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/gityizhou/CITS5506-IoT-Project.git
```


Generate a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
Unix:
$ python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Windows:
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) $ _
